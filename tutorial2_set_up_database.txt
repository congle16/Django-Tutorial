1. DATABASE SET UP
    Now, open up mysite/settings.py. It’s a normal Python module with module-level variables representing Django settings.
    By default, the configuration uses SQLite. 
    If you’re new to databases, or you’re just interested in trying Django, this is the easiest choice. 
    SQL, to avoid database-switching headaches down the road.SQLite is included in Python, so you won’t need to install anything else to support your database. 
    When starting your first real project, however, you may want to use a more scalable database like Postgre

    If you wish to use another database, install the appropriate database bindings 
    and change the following keys in the DATABASES 'default' item to match your database connection settings:
        + ENGINE – Either 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'django.db.backends.postgresql', 'django.db.backends.mysql', or 'django.db.backends.oracle'. Other backends are also available.
        + NAME – The name of your database. If you’re using SQLite, the database will be a file on your computer; in that case, NAME should be the full absolute path, including filename, of that file. 
        The default value, BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3', will store the file in your project directory.

    While you’re editing mysite/settings.py, set TIME_ZONE to your time zone.

    By default, INSTALLED_APPS contains the following apps, all of which come with Django:
        - django.contrib.admin – The admin site. You’ll use it shortly.
        - django.contrib.auth – An authentication system.
        - django.contrib.contenttypes – A framework for content types.
        - django.contrib.sessions – A session framework.
        - django.contrib.messages – A messaging framework.
        - django.contrib.staticfiles – A framework for managing static files.

    $ python manage.py migrate

    The migrate command looks at the INSTALLED_APPS setting and creates any necessary database tables according to the database settings in your mysite/settings.py file and 
    the database migrations shipped with the app (we’ll cover those later). 
    You’ll see a message for each migration it applies.
